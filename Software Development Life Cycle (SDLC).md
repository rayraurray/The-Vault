Software development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.

SDLC specifies the task(s) to be performed at various stages by a software engineer or developer. It ensures that the end product is able to meet the customer’s expectations and fits within the overall budget. Hence, it’s vital for a software developer to have prior knowledge of this software development process. SDLC is a collection of these six stages, and the stages of SDLC are as follows:
1. Planning and Requirements Analysis
2. Defining Requirements
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment and Maintenance
