Multiclass classification is **the process of assigning entities with two or more classes**. Each entity is assigned to one class without any overlap. An example of multiclass classification, using images of vegetables, where each image is either a carrot, tomato, or zucchini.

Multiclass Classification with logistic regression can be done through:
[[One-vs-All Binary Logistic Regression]]
[[Multinomial Logistic Regression]]
