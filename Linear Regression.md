Linear [[Regression]] is an algorithm used in machine learning to model the relationship between two variables, 𝑥 and 𝑦 . The 𝑦 denotes the dependent variable while the 𝑥 denotes the independent variables. 

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

The model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Linear regression is one of the supervised learning techniques.
