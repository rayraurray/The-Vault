# Verification and Validation
## Validation
- Are we building the right product?  
- Do requirements meet stakeholders’ expectations?  
- Are requirements realistic, achievable, prioritized?
## Verification
- Are we building the product right?  
- Are the requirements implemented correctly?
# Traceability
Traceability needed in both forward and backward directions:  
- Where did a requirement come from? Does it “origin” from a business goal? What priority does it have?
- Where in the design/implementation is this requirement addressed?
- What are the implications on design/implementation if this requirement is changed?
