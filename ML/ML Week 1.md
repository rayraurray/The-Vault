-ML is the process of training a piece of software (model) to make a useful prediction of a dataset.
-This predictive model can then serve up predictions about previously unseen data -> taking action.
![[Basic Description of ML.png]]
# Rational Understanding
-Target function ùëì is unknown, learning algorithms cannot obtain a perfect function ùëì.
-Hypotheses function ùëî approximates function ùëì, but maybe different from  
function ùëì.

# Process
-Collect the data
-Prepare the data
	Data processing
	Feature extraction
	Feature scaling and selection
-Modeling (a cycle of):
	Validation
	Hyperparameter tuning
	Training
-Deployment

## When to use
| Rule-based                                                                                            | ML                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lower volumes of data<br>Relative simplicity<br>Speedy output<br>Clear and constant data distribution | Simple rules, guidelines don't apply<br>Complex rules and intensive issues<br>Long term problem -> Manageability and improvement and enhancement<br>Data distinction changes over time -> Constant adaptation

# Project Example
## 1. Data Preparation  
- MINIST datasets  
- Training set: 60,000 handwriting images and corresponding labels  
- Testing set: 10,000 handwriting images and corresponding labels
## 2. Network structure definition

## 3. Network Compilation
Model compilation involves the following three parts:  
- Loss function: measures how accurate the output is  
- Optimizer: measures how the model is updated  
- Metrics: monitors the training to determine when to stop
## 4. Model Training
All training data is trained through batch iteration.  
In TensorFlow, model.fit is used for training .  
An "epoch" refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset.

## 5. Model Evaluation
In TensorFlow, model.evaluate is used for testing.  
It compares the predicted results with the groundtruth label to calculate the accuracy of the test set.
