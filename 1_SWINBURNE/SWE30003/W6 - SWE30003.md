# Heuristics for System Classes
Heuristic 2.8 (p. 19)  
	A class should capture one and only one key abstraction  
	Key abstraction = important concept of the domain model  
	If this is violated, we immediately reduce cohesion  
Heuristic 2.9 (p. 20)  
	Keep related data and behavior in one place  
	Otherwise, need to define (unnecessary) accessor methods and/or “data-holder” only classes, implying increased **coupling**
Heuristic 3.1 (p. 33)  
	Distribute system intelligence horizontally as uniformly as possible, that is, top-level classes of the system should share their work uniformly  
	One needs to think where the system objects are created!  
Heuristic 3.2 (p. 33)  
	Do not create [[God Classes]]/Objects in your system  
	A God Class implies many responsibilities, hence significant complexity, hence difficult to understand and maintain.  
	God Classes are often prone to contain many defects!

# Inheritance
[[Inheritance]]
**Inheritance = Incremental Derivation**
## Taxonomy
![[taxonomy of inheritance.png]]Model inheritance, reflecting “is-a” relations between abstractions in the model.  

Software inheritance, expressing relations within the software itself rather than in the model.  
Some of them are considered “bad practice”

Variation inheritance - a special case that may pertain either to the software or to the model - serving to describe a class through its differences with another class.

## Heuristics
Heuristic 5.1 (p. 81)  
	Inheritance should be used only to model a specialization hierarchy  
	We will revisit this heuristics later on  
Heuristic 5.2 (p. 81)  
	Derived classes must have knowledge of their base class (by definition), but base classes should not know anything about their derived classes  
	Never make explicit reference to a subclass!!
Heuristic 5.4 (p. 84)  
	In theory, inheritance hierarchies should be deep - the deeper, the better  
	“Correct” set of responsibilities at each level.  
Heuristic 5.5 (p. 84)  
	In practice, inheritance hierarchies should be no deeper than an average developer can keep in his/her short-term memory  
	Developers must be able to work with a given abstraction  hierarchy! Assume 5 to 7 be a maximum depth.  
	Empirical studies show that hierarchies are rarely deep
 Heuristic 5.12 (p. 98)  
	Explicit case analysis on the type of an object is usually an error. The designer should use polymorphism in most cases  
	Case analysis also often reveals misassigned responsibilities!  
Heuristic 5.16 (p. 113)  
	It should be illegal for a derived class to override a base class method with a method that does nothing.
	Declaring a NOP method implies that this class does not have a particular responsibility!
# Abtract Classes
[[Abstraction (Software)]]

Abstract classes factor out common behavior shared by other classes (i.e. their subclasses)  
	Group related classes with common responsibilities  
	Introduce abstract parent classes to represent the group  
	“Categories” are good candidates for abstract classes
## Heuristics
Heuristic 5.6 (p. 89)  
	All abstract classes must be base classes  
	No point having abstract classes that are not derived from!  
Heuristic 5.7 (p.89)  
	All base classes should be abstract classes  
	In an inheritance tree, only leaf nodes should be concrete classes, all other nodes are abstract.  
	Note: there is often a perceived need to violate this!

# Base Classes
Classes that share common responsibilities should inherit from a common abstract superclass; introduce any that are missing.
## Heuristics
Heuristic 5.8 (p. 93)  
	Factor the commonality of data, behaviour and/or interface as high as possible in the inheritance hierarchy  
	Reduces the amount of classes where specific information is kept  
		Reduces maintenance overhead later on  
		May introduce complexity early on
# Building Good Hierarchies

Make sure that abstract classes do not inherit from concrete classes:  
	Eliminate by introducing **common abstract superclass**: abstract classes should support responsibilities in an **implementation-independent** way.  

Eliminate classes that do not add functionality: 
	Classes should either add new responsibilities, or a particular way of implementing inherited ones
## Sharing Responsibilities
Concrete classes may be both instantiated and inherited from. 
	(Bad practice to subclass a concrete class, though!)
Abstract classes may only be inherited from. 
[[Venn Diagrams]] can be used to visualize shared responsibilities (Warning: not part of UML!).

## "Kind-of" Hierarchy
Subclasses should/must support all inherited responsibilities, and possibly more.  
Subclasses may refine/specialize an inherited responsibility, but should never hide a responsibility from a parent class.

**Incorrect Subclass/Superclass Relationships**  
G assumes only some of the responsibilities inherited from E  
![[eg sumth.png]]

**Revised Inheritance Relationships**  
Introduce abstract superclasses to encapsulate common responsibilities

# Roles and Protocols
Within an object-oriented application, objects collaborate to perform the desired/required responsibilities.  

Collaborations are often described using protocols (interfaces and interaction sequences/dependencies)  

Each participant in a collaboration plays a given role.  

Roles can be either fixed or unbound.  
	Unbound roles can be used for tailoring an application (i.e. create a new class which can play this role).

## Example
Drawing Element is a class of the graphics editor; it defines three roles:  
	Client: uses other elements of the application (i.e. other element classes; e.g. Line Element)  
	Child: can be contained in a Group Element  
	Subject: state being observed by other elements (e.g., Selection Tool)  
Each of these roles implies  
	a number of related responsibilities  
	the usage of a particular collaboration protocol (e.g., a sequence of method invocations)

![[Protocols and Roles.png]]
## Interaction Heuristics
Heuristic 4.1 (p. 57)  
	Minimize the number of classes with which another class collaborates  
	Too many collaborators generally implies misassigned and/or incorrectly identified responsibilities  
Heuristic 4.3 (p. 59)  
	Minimize the amount of collaboration between a class and its collaborator(s), that is, the number of messages sent  
	Implies that a collaboration protocol will have to be implemented using “few” methods  
	This can be quite problematic in some cases!
Heuristic 3.9 (p. 43)  
	Do not turn an operation into a class  
	Be cautious when the name of a potential class is derived from a verb  
	However, there are situation when you do want operations to be encoded in a separate class!
	For example, Strategies, Commands etc.  

# Associations and Aggregations
## Example
A `Group Element` contains multiple `Drawing Elements` (in fact, instances of concrete subclasses thereof)  
	Do we use aggregation or association to model this relationship?  
	What is the “best” way to represent associations and/or aggregations?

Clearly, the “children” of a `Group Element` can exist without its enclosing `Group Element` instance  
$\rightarrow$ we need to use association, not aggregation, to model this relationship!  

![[asso and aggre.png]]

# Collections
The elements of an association/aggregation generally need some form of expandable container/collection in the corresponding enclosing object  

But what kind of container/collection do we choose?  
We need to be clear what kind of access we need for the elements of an association/aggregation!

Only enumeration of elements needed  
	Choose the most general collection available  
Want to avoid duplicates?  
	Choose a set-like collection  
Need to be able to access specific elements?  
	Choose an “indexable” collection (e.g., Array, List, Hash)  
Need a specific order in enumerations  
	Choose a collection that allows ordering of elements  
Need some combination of the above?  
	Choose a collection that combines various behaviors  
$\rightarrow$ Most collection libraries provide various kinds of suitable classes

# Abstract vs Concrete State
Every object (bar a few rare exceptions) contains stateful information (an object has state).  Externally visible properties of this state defines its abstract state  
	E.g. Stack: size, order of elements, top element  
Internal representations define the concrete state  
	E.g. Stack may use a list or array to “store” its elements  
Clients should only ever rely on an object’s abstract state, not its concrete state.  
Object equality should only ever be defined over the abstract, but not concrete state.

# Command-Query Separation Principle
Divide all methods of a class into two, non-overlapping categories:  
- Queries  
	Return a result, but do not change the observable state of an object (that is, the method is free of observable side-effects)  
	The abstract state of an object remains invariant!  
	However, the concrete state may change (e.g., for caching)  
- Commands (aka modifiers)  
	Change the (abstract) state of an object, but do not return a value (other than termination)  

# Design By Contract
A design concept introduced by Bertrand Meyer in the late 1980.  

Key premise: view the relationship between a service provider (e.g., an object) and service consumer (e.g., a client of this object – possibly another object) as a formal agreement (or contract), specifying each party’s rights and obligations.  

In practice: extend the definition of abstract data types (e.g., classes) with pre-conditions, post-conditions, invariants, and how these three concepts can be refined in subclasses.

A service consumer must ensure that a service (method) on a provider is only ever invoked when this service’s pre-condition is met.  
	Pre-conditions must be expressed in terms of the public interface of a service!  
	If the pre-condition is not met, there is no obligation on the provider’s side to do anything “sensible”  
A service provider must ensure that, after successful completion of a service, the service post-condition is met.
	A service consumer can rely on the specified post-condition.  
	Any errors in the execution of a service must be flagged to the consumer!

Invariants of the service provider must hold after the successful execution of any of its externally visible services  
	During execution, they may be (obviously) violated...  
Subclasses can only  
	Weaken pre-conditions to services  
	Strengthen post-conditions of services and/or invariants  
Tools can assist in enforcing contracts and/or detect contract violations!

## Benefits
Explicit notion of “contextualized” correctness  
Enforces separation of concerns  
	Helps in assigning responsibilities to the “correct” class  
Facilitates testing and debugging  
	There are even smart compilers that use it for optimizations!  
Enhances documentation  
	As a consequence, facilitates reuse
