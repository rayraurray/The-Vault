Multiple [[Linear Regression]] refers to a method when dealing with multiple independent variable 𝑥.

Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a method used to model the linear relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable.  
- The price of a house is correlated to its size in square feet and the number of bedrooms.  
MLR based on the assumption that the independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other.  
- The size and number of bedrooms are not highly correlated.

- Hypothesis ℎ𝜃 𝑥 is represented as:  
ℎ𝜃(𝑥) = 𝜃0𝑥0+ 𝜃1𝑥1 + 𝜃2𝑥2+ ... +𝜃𝑀𝑥𝑀  
- Parameters: 
𝜃0, ..., 𝜃𝑀  
- Cost function:

- Goal
