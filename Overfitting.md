Overfitting is **an undesirable machine learning behavior that occurs when the machine learning model gives accurate predictions for training data but not for new data**. When data scientists use machine learning models for making predictions, they first train the model on a known data set.

A model that can fit well to the training data, but not generalized to new and unseen testing data.  
Low bias, high variance  
Normal causes of overfitting:  
- Model is too complex.  
- Model was trained with a small amount of training data.

# Dealing with Overfitting
Dealing with the complexity of a model by reducing the number of features by the following methods:  
Manual selection of features  
Model selection  
Adding regularization penalties  
The size of the features is retained but the magnitude of the weights 𝜃𝑗  
is reduced.  
Collecting more training data
