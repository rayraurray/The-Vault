Overfitting is **an undesirable machine learning behavior that occurs when the machine learning model gives accurate predictions for training data but not for new data**. When data scientists use machine learning models for making predictions, they first train the model on a known data set.

A model that can fit well to the training data, but not generalized to new and unseen testing data.  

**Low bias, high variance**  

Normal causes of overfitting: Model is too complex and/or was trained with a small amount of training data.
