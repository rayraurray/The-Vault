# Structured Data
Structured data is data whose elements are addressable for effective analysis. It has been organized into a formatted repository that is typically a database. It concerns all data which can be stored in database SQL in a table with rows and columns. They have relational keys and can easily be mapped into pre-designed fields. Today, those data are most processed in the development and simplest way to manage information. Example: Relational data. 
 
# Semi-Structured Data 
Semi-structured data is information that does not reside in a relational database but that has some organizational properties that make it easier to analyze. With some processes, you can store them in the relation database (it could be very hard for some kind of semi-structured data), but Semi-structured exist to ease space. Example: XML data. 
 
# Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is a data which is not organized in a predefined manner or does not have a predefined data model, thus it is not a good fit for a mainstream relational database. So for Unstructured data, there are alternative platforms for storing and managing, it is increasingly prevalent in IT systems and is used by organizations in a variety of business intelligence and analytics applications. Example: Word, PDF, Text, Media logs.
