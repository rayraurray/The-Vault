# Knowledge Discovery Enabled by [[Data]]
1. Define Objectives
2. Conclude Data Requirements
3. Store Data
4. Clean into Target Data
5. Save Preprocessed Data
6. Transform Data
7. Identify Patterns within the Data
![[Knowledge From Data.png]]
## 1. Objective(s)
A statement of problem, dilemma, or issue to be resolved
There is a need to understand context and domain
The type of problem/dilemma/issue and the goal may require:
- Specific data/datasets;
- Specific methodology/algorithm/analytics
## 2. Data Requirements
Identification of data required to approach and/or solve the problems and achieve the objective
- Data availability & accessibility
- Data sources
- Data location
- Data types
- Data Credibility
Start thinking about logical and plausible correlations
- Assumptions, hypotheses, observations
- Historical data, current knowledge
- Research
## 3. Data Sources
Selection and/or sourcing of Databases/data containers containing the data
- Internal and/or External Data
- Relational DBs, Sales Database, Customer Transaction DB, etc.
- Documents, Photos, Videos, etc.
- Social Media, Vlogs, Blogs, Forums, etc.
## 4. Target Data
lmao obvious
## 5. Preprocessed Data
Select and determine the most relevant subsets of data
	More appropriate for data mining
	In most cases it may require reduction of dimensionality and data transformation methods to
	reduce the number of variables
Data transformation
	Aggregation of data (create a summary of a group of data)
	Normalization (to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity)
	Data smoothing (algorithm to remove ”noise” from a data set)
Data reductions
	Dimension reduction using alternative grouping techniques i.e., Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS)
	Compression techniques (i.e., clustering)
	Concept hierarchy (think of it as “groupings” of certain range of data into a higher level hierarchy of concept. E.g., 0-3 Low, 4-7 Med, 8-10 High, Etc.

## 6. Transformed Data
Considered to be "cleaned data" with good integrity and "trustworthiness"
Compact, robust, and complete enough, to approach the stated objectives
Ready to be mined
	Exploration
	Predictive
	Descriptive
Mining based on specific associations and/or "rules" and/or algorithm
	Standard statistical methods
	Classification Trees
	Decision Trees
	[[Regression]] models
To be effective, normally involved multidisciplinary knowledge
	STEM, including machine learning, AI, etc.,
	[[Psychology]], Human & Cons. Behavior, etc.
	Other domain specific knowledge
# 7. Patterns
In the simplest form, patterns are a series of data that repeats in a recognizable manner
A pattern does not necessarily signify something of importance nor accurate nor usable
Technically, any algorithm applied onto a large dataset will produce some forms of pattern
