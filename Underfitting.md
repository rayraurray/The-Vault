Underfitting is **a scenario in data science where a data model is unable to capture the relationship between the input and output variables accurately**, generating a high error rate on both the training set and unseen data.

A model is too simple that performs poorly on both the training and testing data.

**High bias, low variance**.

Normal causes of Underfitting: Model is too simple. An example of this situation would be the construction of a linear regression model on non-linear data.
