First of all Object Oriented Design is not Object Oriented Programming.
# Preliminaries
## Decomposition
Decomposition is a process that helps to manage the complexity of the system  
1. Starts with a high-level view of the system.  
2. Low-level details of the features of the system are created based on high-level  
3. Stop when we are satisfied with the level of detail.  
Also known as **Divide-and-Conquer**.

## Coupling and Cohesion
[[Coupling]]
[[Cohesion]]
Two measures of how well the parts of a system are tied together to form the system itself.  
They also give good indication of how “good” the design is  
- Coupling:  
	measure the inter-dependency between system parts  
- Cohesion:  
	measure the intra-dependency of a system part  
Goal: Weak Coupling and Strong Cohesion > Good Object-oriented design attempts to achieve this!

Both coupling and cohesion are important factors in determining the maintainability, scalability, and reliability of a software system. High coupling and low cohesion can make a system difficult to change and test, while low coupling and high cohesion make a system easier to maintain and improve.
# Objects and Classes
## What is an Object?
Analysis and modeling view:  
- an abstract model of a real world entity that has an independent identity.  
- E.g., Computer, Person, Car  
Design and implementation view:
- a software component that contains a collection of data and related procedures.  
An object represents something in real world that has an independent identity and is something that you can interact with:  
An object has behaviour which may depend on its internal state which may change by responding to messages.  
## Object

## Processing Element
![[process elem.png]]

## Class
A class is a description of a group of objects with  
	common data attributes  
	common operations  
	common relationships to objects; and  
	common semantics (i.e. “meaning”)  
Classes are used to create objects:  
Such objects are called instances of their creating class  
Object-Oriented Design often focuses on identifying classes, not objects. But, Analysis & dynamic behavior in terms of objects.

## UML
Objects are shown as rectangles with their name and type underlined in one compartment, and attribute values, optionally, in a second compartment.

# Object Oriented Design
[[Object Oriented Design]]

A method of design encompassing the process of object-oriented decomposition. 

A notation for depicting the (detailed) characteristics of the system under design  

View the system as the interactions of different objects.

Problem: many OO design approaches focus too much on the relationships

Goal:  
- To find the important object-based abstractions of the system  
- What happens if we find the wrong abstraction?  
- Iterate and correct the model  

Questions (of importance)  
	How can we identify objects (or classes)?  
	How do objects interact?  
	What roles and responsibilities do objects perform?  
	etc. before writing down in UML/program!

# Finding Classes
## Basics
1. Find the classes in your system.  
2. Determine the responsibilities of each class.  
3. Determine how objects collaborate with each other to fulfill their responsibilities.

## Details
1. Factor common responsibilities to build class hierarchies  
2. Streamline collaborations between objects:  
	Is message traffic heavy in parts of the system?  
	Are there classes that collaborate with everybody?  
	Are there classes that collaborate with nobody?  
	Are there groups of classes that can be seen as subsystems?  
3. Apply design heuristics to improve specific design aspects

## Start with the requirements  
What are the goals of the system being designed, its expected inputs, and desired responses?  
1. Look for noun phrases:  
	separate into obvious classes, uncertain candidates, and nonsense.  
	Note: we did something similar to create a domain model! – extend/refine and revise here.
2. Refine to a list of candidate classes. Some guidelines are:  
	Model physical objects — e.g. disks, printers  
	Model conceptual entities — e.g. windows, files  
	Choose one word for one concept — what does it mean within the system  
	Be wary of adjectives — is it really a separate class?  
	Be wary of missing or misleading subjects — rephrase in active voice  
	Model categories of classes — delay modeling of inheritance  
	Model interfaces to the system — e.g., user interface, program interfaces  
	Model attribute values, not attributes — e.g., Point vs. Centre
# Class Selection Rationale
Refer to [[yapping about Drawing Editor]]

Model physical objects:  
	- ~~Mouse Button~~ $\rightarrow$ Event or Attribute 
Model conceptual entities:  
	- Ellipse, line, rectangle  
	- Drawing, Drawing Element  
	- Tool, Creation Tool, Ellipse Creation Tool, Line Creation Tool, Rectangle - Creation Tool, Selection Tool, Text Creation Tool  
	- Text, Character  
	- Current Selection

Choose one word for one concept:  
	- Drawing Editor $\rightarrow$ ~~editor, interactive graphics editor~~  
	- Drawing Element $\rightarrow$ ~~element~~
	- Text Element $\rightarrow$ ~~text~~
	- Ellipse Element, Line Element, Rectangle Element  $\rightarrow$ ~~ellipse, line, rectangle~~

Be wary of adjectives:  
	- Ellipse Creation Tool, Line Creation Tool, Rectangle Creation Tool,  
	Selection Tool, Text Creation Tool $\rightarrow$ all have different requirements  
	- ~~Bounding rectangle, rectangle, region~~ $\rightarrow$ Rectangle (Common meaning, but different from Rectangle Element!)  
	- Point $\rightarrow$ ~~end point, start point, stop point~~  
	- Control Point $\rightarrow$ More than just a coordinate  
	- Corner $\rightarrow$ ~~associated corner, diagonally opposite corner~~ (no new behavior)

Be wary of sentences with missing or misleading subjects:  
	“The current selection is indicated visually by displaying the control points for the element.” (by what? Assume Drawing Editor)  
Model categories:  
	Tool, Creation Tool  
Model interfaces to the system: — no good candidates here
	~~user~~ — don’t need to model user explicitly  
	~~cursor~~ — cursor motion handled by operating system

Model values of attributes, not attributes themselves:  
	~~height of the rectangle, width of the rectangle~~
	~~major radius, minor radius~~
	~~position~~ — of first text character; probably Point attribute  
	~~mode of operation~~ — attribute of Drawing Editor  
	~~shape of the cursor, I-beam, crosshair~~ — attributes of Cursor  
	~~corner~~ — attribute of Rectangle  
	~~time~~— an implicit attribute of the system

# Class Responsibility Collaboration Cards
![[CRC cards.png]]

CRC cards are not a specification of a design.  
They are a tool to explore possible designs.  
	Prepare a CRC card for each candidate class  
	Get a team of Developers to sit around a table and distribute the cards to the team 
	The team walks through scenarios, playing the roles of instances of the identified (candidate) classes.
This exercise will uncover:  
	unneeded classes and responsibilities, and  
	missing classes and responsibilities.
# Identifying Responsibilities
Responsibilities are the knowledge an object maintains and provides, the actions it can perform.  

Responsibilities represent the public services an object may provide to clients (but not the way in which those services may be implemented)  
	Specify what an object does, not how it does it.  
	Do not describe the interface yet, only conceptual responsibilities.

Study the requirements specification:  
	Highlight verbs and determine which represent responsibilities  
	Perform a walk-though of the system  
	Explore as many scenarios as possible  
	Identify actions resulting from input to the system

Study the candidate classes
	Class names $\rightarrow$ Roles $\rightarrow$ Responsibilities  
	Recorded purposes on class cards $\rightarrow$ responsibilities

Evenly distribute system intelligence  
	Avoid procedural centralization of responsibilities  
	Keep responsibilities close to objects rather than their clients  
	Note: this is not always possible (or even desirable)!  
State responsibilities as generally as possible  
	“draw yourself” vs. “draw a line/rectangle etc.”  
	leads to sharing  
Keep behavior together with any related information (principle of encapsulation).

Keep information about one thing in one place  
	If multiple objects need access to the same information  
	1. a new object may be introduced to manage the information, or  
	2. one object may be an obvious candidate, or  
	3. the multiple objects may need to be collapsed into a single one  

Share responsibilities among related objects  
	break down complex responsibilities  

Maintaining information is a responsibility  
	But: avoid “data-holder” only classes!

# Relationships Between Classes
Additional responsibilities can be uncovered by examining relationships between classes.

## The “Is-Kind-Of” Relationship  
Classes sharing a common attribute often share a common superclass  
Common super-classes suggest common responsibilities  
To create a new Drawing Element, a Creation Tool must:  
1. Accept user input implemented in subclass  
2. Determine location to place it generic  
3. Instantiate the element implemented in subclass
## The “Is-Analogous-To” Relationship:  
Similarities between classes suggest as-yet-undiscovered superclasses  

## The “Is-Part-Of” Relationship:  
Distinguish (don’t share) responsibilities of part and of whole  

## Examples
Drawing element **is-part-of** Drawing  
Drawing Element **has-knowledge-of** Control Points  
Rectangle Tool **is-kind-of** Creation Tool

Difficulties in assigning responsibilities suggest:  
	missing classes in design, or — e.g., Group Element,  
	free choice between multiple classes.  

# Collaborations
**Collaborations** are client requests to servers needed to fulfill responsibilities.

Collaborations reveal control and information flow and can uncover missing responsibilities.
Analysis of communication patterns can reveal misassigned responsibilities.

## Finding Collaborations
For each responsibility:  
1. Can the class fulfill the responsibility by itself?  
2. If not, what does it need, and from what other class can it obtain what it needs?  
For each class:
1. What does this class know?  
2. What other classes need its information or results? Check for collaborations.  
3. Classes that do not interact with others should be discarded. (Check carefully!)

# Summary
An application = a set of interacting objects  
An object = an implementation of one or more roles  
A role = a set of related responsibilities  
A responsibility = an obligation to perform a task or know  
certain information  
A collaboration = an interaction of objects or roles
