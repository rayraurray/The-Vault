# Data - Information - Knowledge
Data is content that does not yet have meaning 
Information is data that has context
Knowledge is information that has meaning

Discrete facts about an event (Data) -> Data with analyzed relationships and connections (Information) -> Contextualized Information (Knowledge) -> Wisdom.
