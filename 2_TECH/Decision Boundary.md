The decision boundaries separates the data-points into decision regions, which are actually the classes in which they belong.  
After training a machine learning model using a dataset, it is often necessary to visualize the classification of the data-points in Feature Space.
# Example
For example, our task is to classify two different species of Iris (setosa and versicolor) from a series of $\large N$ training data, based on the features (sepal width, petal length, etc.) of the flower organ.
