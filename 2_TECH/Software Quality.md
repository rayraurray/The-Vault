# Problems
Software specifications are usually incomplete and often inconsistent with regards to quality.  
There is tension between:
- Customer quality requirements (efficiency, reliability, etc.)  
- Developer quality requirements (maintainability, reusability, etc.)  
Some quality requirements are hard to specify in an unambiguous way  
- Directly measurable qualities (e.g., errors/KLOC),  
- Indirectly measurable qualities (e.g., usability, user “engagement”).
