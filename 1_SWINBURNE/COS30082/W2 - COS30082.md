# What is a [[Regression]] problem?
A regression problem is when the target output can be represented by a real or continuous value, such as "age" or "weight".

Non-regression problem is when the target output may be classified by non-numerical values, such as "gender", or "religion".
- [[Linear Regression]]
- [[Simple Linear Regression]]
- [[Multiple Linear Regression]]
- [[Polynomial Regression]]

Although a higher order polynomial model may allow better modeling of the data, it is likely to lead to overfitting.
