# Dependance on Info
Increased dependency on information
	"The diffusion of technology and the commodification of information
	transforms the role of information into a resource equal in importance to the
	traditionally important resources of land, labor and capital"
Strategic use of Big Data/Analytics may influence the strategic direction of the organization
	The issue of Data and Information at a strategic level ultimately is the responsibility of the board
Use and utilization of Big Data may transect with issues related to compliance and/or legal
	Privacy Laws, Privacy Principles, Corporation Act, Consumers Law, Data Protection Law, etc.

## Governance in Public Sector

# Necessary Questions
Directors and executive managers need to ask these two basic questions:
	What responsibility does my organisation have for protecting data& information, particularly information that belongs to others?
	What responsibility does my organisation have to keep its information systems (and by association, data and information) from being used to harm others?
Leading to the repercussions if this responsibility is breached …
	Potential for management and/or executive to be Vicariously Liable

$\rightarrow$ **DUE CARE and DUE DILIGENCE**

# Big Data Strategies
Strategy = the means by which an organization acquires and uses resources and takes action to achieve long term aims.
Strategy = the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities to ones competitors (the “Porter-ian” view of the business world).
