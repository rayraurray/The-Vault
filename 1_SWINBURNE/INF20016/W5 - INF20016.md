# Large and Unstructured Data
In the context of the 6Vs, the data is often:  
- Difficult (or at least, challenging) to analyse  
- Too large and too “fast” to analyse  
	Which is the most promising subset to analyse? ...but how do we know?  
	Often a “hit and miss” exercise = not effective = not resource friendly  
	May result in important (potential) insights be ignored and/or be  
	missed  
- May require an extensive infrastructure to process  
	Storage, Memory, and overall computing resources  
	More advance analytics architecture and infrastructure (i.e., Stream  
	Analytics and Real-Time analytics which requires MPP, CEP, in-memory  
	capabilities)

# Ways to deal with the 6Vs
Reduce the complexity of the content
	Categorisations of content  
	Create a hierarchy of category/topics/subtopics of interest  
	Develop Data-dictionary and develop word/phrase associations  
	Semantic analysis  
Algorithm based techniques to extract topological structures of data
	Network Theory/Graph Theory  
	Compression  
	Data deduplication/Redundancy elimination  
	Data Preprocessing based on semantic analysis and linked data structures  
	Dimension reduction  
	Data Mining & Machine Learning  
	Etc
# Metadata
## Sources
Include, but not limited to:  
- Automatically generated by a device (or rather, the S/W used by the device)  
- Automatically generated by an event/session-handler  
- Created/generated by a system, an app, a designer of the system, people following a certain process.

## Standards
RDF/RDFa  
	Resource Description Framework (a = in attributes)  
	Govern the attribute level extensions to HTML, XHTM, XML and their variants
Dublin Core  
	One of the widely used in the archival, library studies, and  
	information management field  
Schema.org  
	Aimed at providing structure to the internet-related data (i.e., web, email, etc.) including capturing the relationships between entities and action (i.e., use of)  
	Collaborative communities, including Google, Microsoft, yahoo

## From Users' Metadata to Data Warehouse
![[From Users' Metadata to Data Warehouse.png]]
1. End-user metadata quality use moderately influence user’s attitudes toward data
2. Contribute to satisfaction to the usefulness of the data in the data warehouse
3. More utilization of data
