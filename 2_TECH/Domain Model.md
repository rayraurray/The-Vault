A domain model captures the domain entities (or concepts) relevant to a given problem specification
A domain vocabulary generally defines the meaning (or interpretation) of domain entities
The relationships between domain entities define an abstraction over the problem domain.

# Process
1. Perform a textual analysis of the problem specification for  
understanding the problem domain  
2. Write down relevant domain entities. They are normally (some of)  
the nouns defined above.  
3. Revisit the specification to extract the associations  
4. Record associations with the corresponding domain entities.
