# Personal Knowledge Vault

This Vault contains an attempt to capture the entirety of the knowledge known by the author of this repository.

A home for notes, references, and project materials organized by topic and purpose. Think of it as a personal “second brain” where each folder holds a distinct category of information or resource.

- **Markdown** (`.md`) for all text‑based notes and READMEs.
- **Images** stored in `0_IMAGES` with a matching name to reference easily.
