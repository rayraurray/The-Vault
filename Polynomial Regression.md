Polynomial Regression is a form of [[Linear Regression]] in which the relationship between the independent variable $\large x$ and dependent variable $\large y$ is modelled as an nth-degree polynomial.

[[Simple Linear Regression]] models could not fit the data well if the independent data, 𝑥 exhibits nonlinear relationship with the dependent data, $\large y$

Higher Order Polynomial regression model can better fit the training data.

# Relation with Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial regression is consider a special case of [[Multiple Linear Regression]].
Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, it is linear to the parameters $\large \theta_0, \theta_1, ..., \theta_j$ .
