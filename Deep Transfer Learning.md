[[Transfer Learning]]

Deep transfer learning is a [[Machine Learning]]technique that utilizes the knowledge learned from one task to improve the performance of another related task. This technique is particularly useful when there is a shortage of labeled data for the target task, as it allows the model to leverage the knowledge learned from a similar task with a larger dataset, this is based on the idea that the lower layers of a [[Neural Network]], such as the [[Convolutional Neural Network]], learn general features that are useful for a wide range of tasks, while the higher layers learn task-specific features.
