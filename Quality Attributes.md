Quality attributes apply both to the product and the process.  
- product: delivered to the customer  
- process: produces the software product  
- resources: (both the product and the process require resources)  
Underlying assumption: a quality process leads to a quality product (cf. metaphor of manufacturing lines).  
This is not necessarily true for software! Perhaps the appropriate statement is: “A quality process is more likely to lead to quality software more often”.

Quality attributes can be external or internal.  
- External: Derived from the relationship between the environment and the system (or the process).  
	Often relate to form, not function. 
	e.g. Reliability, Usability  
- Internal: Derived immediately from the product or process description:  
	Underlying assumption: internal quality leads to external quality (cf.  
	metaphor manufacturing lines)  
	e.g. Efficiency, Operability
