Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of [[Computer Science]] and [[Artificial Intelligence]] that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language. 

NLP enables computers and digital devices to recognize, understand and generate text and speech by combining computational linguistics—the rule-based modeling of human language—together with statistical modeling, [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]]. 

NLP research has enabled the era of generative AI, from the communication skills of [[Large Language Model]]s (LLMs) to the ability of image generation models to understand requests. NLP is already part of everyday life for many, powering search engines, prompting [[Chatbot]]s for customer service with spoken commands, voice-operated GPS systems and digital assistants on smartphones.
