Transfer learning is a [[Machine Learning]] technique in which knowledge gained through one task or dataset is used to improve model performance on another related task and/or different dataset.

Simply speaking, it's the ability of a system to recognize and apply knowledge and skills learned in previous tasks to novel tasks or new domains, which share some commonality.

Given a target task, how to identify the commonality between the task and previous (source) tasks, and transfer knowledge from the previous tasks to the target one

# Purpose
To leverage knowledge from previously trained models for training newer models
To accelerate the learning process
To improve generalization
To tackle dataset bottlenecks $\rightarrow$ Reduce the need for data related to the target task
