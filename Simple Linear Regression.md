Simple [[Linear Regression]] refers to a method when dealing with a single independent variable 𝑥.

For example, from a series of 𝑁 training set, we want to model the relationship between the height and width of sea bream (a type of fish species).

We assign height as the independent variable, 𝑥 and width as the dependent variable, 𝑦 .  
If we plot the data, we can see a positive relationship between the two variables.

![[Regression Example.png]]

The relationship between the two variables 𝑥 and 𝑦 can be modeled by a linear equation:
$$
ℎ𝜃(𝑥) = 𝜃0 + 𝜃1𝑥
$$
given 𝜃0 is the bias (intercept) , 𝜃1 is the weight (coefficient) associated to 𝑥.
