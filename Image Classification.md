**Image classification** sees an image and can classify it (a dog, an apple, a personâ€™s face). More precisely, it is able to accurately predict that a given image belongs to a certain class. For example, a social media company might want to use it to automatically identify and segregate objectionable images uploaded by users.

Image classification using [[Convolutional Neural Network]]s **involves the extraction of features from the image to observe some patterns in the dataset**.
