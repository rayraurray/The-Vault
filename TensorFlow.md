TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for [[Machine Learning]] and [[Artificial Intelligence]]. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It was developed by the Google Brain team for [[Google]]'s internal use in research and production.
# Features 
Scalability: TensorFlowâ€™s tf.distribute library helps you scale your model from a single GPU to multiple GPUs and to multiple machines using simple APIs that require very few changes to your existing code.  

GPU: TensorFlow supports running computations on a variety of types of devices, including CPU and GPU.  

Multi-lingual: TensorFlow is designed to support multiple client languages. Currently, the best-supported client language is Python. Experimental interfaces for executing and constructing graphs are also available for C++, Java and Go.

Multi-platform: TensorFlow is available on 64-bit Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile computing platforms including Android and iOS.  

Powerful computing: TensorFlow leverages various optimization techniques to make the calculation of mathematical expressions easier and more performant.  

Distributed: TensorFlow can run on different computers from smartphones to computer clusters.
