> I'm building an AI to profit from Polymarket Bitcoin prediction markets. The AI should forecast whether the BTC price will be above or below a certain threshold by a specified date, and use this prediction to decide when to buy, hold, or sell YES/NO shares on Polymarket.

> Please help me with:
> 
> - Designing or improving the prediction model (e.g., time series, classification, sentiment-based, etc.)
> 
> - Finding or integrating reliable data sources for Bitcoin price, sentiment, and market news
> 
> - Calculating expected value based on predicted probabilities and Polymarket odds
> 
> - Implementing a decision-making strategy for bet execution
> 
> - Creating a notification system (via Telegram, Discord, etc.) to alert me when to act
> 
> - Backtesting the strategy using historical data

> Iâ€™d also appreciate any code examples, model suggestions, or links to tools that can help automate this process.
