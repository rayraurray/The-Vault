Computer vision is a field of [[Artificial Intelligence]] that uses [[Machine Learning]] and [[Neural Network]]s to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputsâ€”and to make recommendations or take actions when they see defects or issues.

Established computer vision tasks:
- [[Image Classification]]
- [[Object Detection]]
- **Object tracking** follows or tracks an object once it is detected. This task is often executed with images captured in sequence or real-time video feeds. Autonomous vehicles, for example, need to not only classify and detect objects such as pedestrians, other cars and road infrastructure, they need to track them in motion to avoid collisions and obey traffic laws.
- **Content-based image retrieval** uses computer vision to browse, search and retrieve images from large data stores, based on the content of the images rather than metadata tags associated with them. This task can incorporate automatic image annotation that replaces manual image tagging. These tasks can be used for [digital asset management](https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-asset-management?_ga=2.120950856.1576315431.1708325761-2067957453.1707311480&_gl=1*yz9nf7*_ga*MjA2Nzk1NzQ1My4xNzA3MzExNDgw*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTcwODU5NTE3OC4zNC4xLjE3MDg1OTU2MjIuMC4wLjA.
