Regression is **a supervised machine learning technique which is used to predict continuous values**. The ultimate goal of the regression algorithm is to plot a best-fit line or a curve between the data. The three main metrics that are used for evaluating the trained regression model are variance, bias and error.

Regression is approximating a mapping variable (𝑓) from input variables (𝑋) to a continuous output variable (𝑦).
A continuous output variable is a real-value, such as an integer of floating point value. These are often quantities, such as amounts and sizes.

A regression problem is when the target output can be represented by a real or continuous value, such as “age” or “weight”.
