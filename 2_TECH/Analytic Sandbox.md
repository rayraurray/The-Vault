- Resolve the conflict between the needs of analysts and the traditional EDW or other formally managed corporate data. 
- Data assets gathered from multiple sources and technologies for analysis.
- Enables flexible, high performance analysis in nonproduction environment.
- Reduces costs and risks associated with data replication into “shadow” file systems.
- “Analyst owned” rather than “DBA owned.”
