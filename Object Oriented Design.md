Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is an important approach in system design, emphasizing modularity, reusability, and scalability. By encapsulating data and behavior into objects, OOD mirrors real-world systems, making software easier to understand and maintain. This method leverages principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, fostering robust and flexible architectures. In this article, weâ€™ll delve into the core concepts of OOD, exploring how they streamline the development process and enhance the overall quality of software systems.
