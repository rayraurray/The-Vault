A [[Deep Learning]] framework is an interface, library or a tool which allows us to build deep learning models more easily and quickly, without getting into the details of underlying algorithms.  

Developers no longer need to compile code starting from complex neural networks and backpropagation algorithms. Instead, they can use existing models to configure parameters as required, where the model parameters are automatically trained.  

Moreover, they can add self-defined network layers to the existing models, or select required classifiers and optimization algorithms directly by invoking existing code.
