"Design is the creative process of transforming the problem into a solution. The description of the solution is also called the design."  
  
"The Design of a system determines a set of components and inter-component interfaces that satisfy a specified set of requirements."

"A design is a plan how to build a thing. To design is to build a thing in one’s mind but not yet in the real world — or, better yet, to plan how the real thing can be built."

# Software Design Methods
- Modular:  
	Focus on functions and procedures  
- Data-oriented:  
	Focus on external data sources  
- Event-oriented:  
	How events change states  
- Middle-out:  
	Jackson System Development (JSD)  
- Object-oriented:  
	Identify classes of objects and their inter-relationships  
- Process-oriented:  
	Focus on communication between independent processing entities  

Common to all software design methods: we need support for abstraction, decomposition & composition!

# Abstraction
[[Abstraction (Software)]]

# Models = Abstractions
A model is a simplification of reality.  
(many) models are created for better understanding of the problem, domain or system to build.  
A model can capture and represent,  
	Structure (static model)  
	Behavior (dynamic model)  
Examples:  
	Architectural blue-print of a house  
	Hand-drawn screen

# Domain Models

# Software Design

Design patterns document standard solutions to common (software) design problems:  

“Each pattern systematically names, explains, and evaluates an important and recurring design in object-oriented systems. Our goal is to capture design experience in a form that people can use effectively.”  
Gamma et al., Design Patterns, 199

“In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of the system to be implemented. This shared understanding is called architecture and includes how the system is divided into processing elements (i.e. components) and their interaction through interfaces. Theses components are usually composed of smaller components, but the architecture only includes the ones that are understood by all developers.”
