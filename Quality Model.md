# Hierarchical Quality Model  
## Definition
Define [[Software Quality]] via a hierarchical quality model, i.e. a number of quality attributes (aka quality factors, quality aspects, etc.)

- Availability: is the system providing the service it is supposed to when it is expected to?  
- Modifiability: can reasonable changes be made at reasonable cost?  
- Performance: does the system respond quickly enough to user  input?  
- Security: can authorized users access the services of the system while unauthorized people cannot?  
- Testability: can the system be exercised to a degree that ensures confidence in correctness?  
- Usability: how easy is it for the user to do what is desired?  

*From this point forward, don't pay too much attention if you're studying.*
# McCall and Masumoto Quality Model
**McCallâ€™s Software Quality Model*** was introduced in 1977. This model is incorporated with many attributes, termed software factors, which influence software. The model distinguishes between two levels of quality attributes:
- Quality Factors
- Quality Criteria
