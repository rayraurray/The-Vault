The [[Machine Learning]] Life Cycle is a Sequence of steps or stages that are followed to develop a ML model -> Ensure that the model is designed, developed, and deployed effectively.

The life cycle is iterative, allowing for continuous improvement and optimization.

There isn't a universal machine learning life cycle. The life cycle varies based on the organization's processes, the project's complexity, and the nature of the problem being addressed.

There are some industry-recognized frameworks:
• [[CRISP-DM]] (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining): A standard data mining process also used in machine learning.
• SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess): Developed by SAS, this framework emphasizes the modeling aspect.
• TDSP (Team Data Science Process): Microsoft's agile method for enhancing team collaboration in data science.
• KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases): An older framework for extracting knowledge from databases.
These frameworks provide a foundational structure from which many of the machine learning life cycle models are derived
