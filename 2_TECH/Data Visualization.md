[[Data]] visualization is **the graphical representation of information and data**. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
-***[[Tableau 1]]***

Data visualization is the process of transforming (abstract) data into interactive graphical representations for the purpose of exploration, confirmation, or presentation.

# Visualization

The representation of an object, situation, or set of information as a chart or other image 
-*Oxford Dictionary*

Visualization as in something outside the human (i.e., an external representation of something)

- _Internal visualization_: Formation of mental images (cognitive/psychological perspective).
- _External visualization_: Charts, diagrams, and other visual representations of information

***Humans have limited memory and attentional resources.***

*External tools (e.g., visualisation)* help offload and extend mental processing — _external cognition_. The human visual information processing system processes certain visual features automatically. Understanding how visual information processing works will help us build better visualizations.

# Aspects of Data Visualization

## 1. Vision

- Very high-bandwidth channel
- Parallel processing of information (pre-attentive/‘sub-conscious’)
- Sound processed sequentially and merged over time
- Currently no good ways of producing and displaying taste, touch and smell

$\rightarrow$ ***Visual attributes (e.g., color, shape, orientation)*** can be perceived instantly, before conscious focus.

## 2. Graphics

- Graphics enhance retention, pattern recognition, and comprehension.
- Visual storytelling makes data relatable and actionable.

## 3. Computers

**Limitations of Hand-Drawn Visuals**
- Time-consuming, static, and hard to scale or update.

**Advantages of Digital Tools**:
- Interactivity (zoom/filter/details on demand — per _Shneiderman’s mantra_).
- Reusability, automation, scalability for large datasets.
- Historical reference: Ivan Sutherland’s _Sketchpad_ (1960s) — precursor to modern interactive graphics.

## 4. Why Not Statistics

**Taking into consideration the example of Anscombe’s Quartet**:
- Four datasets with identical statistical properties (mean, variance, regression line), but visually very different.
- Demonstrates how statistical summaries can hide crucial differences and patterns.
