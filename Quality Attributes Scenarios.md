# Definition
Quality Attribute Scenarios (QAS) provide a tool to help identifying non-functional requirements. QAS alone will not guarantee that quality aspects are met!  

Allow for a systematic approach to deal with quality aspects.  

If scenarios are inadequate, do not hesitate to extend them (but with care!).

# Hypothesis
1. Identify the top 3 to 5 quality attributes/factors of the domain.  
	Assume that qualities of similar applications will also be of relevance for the application under consideration  
2. Systematically go through all identified user task.  
	Identify these tasks that make explicit mention of the identified quality  
	attributes  
	Note: “critical” of user tasks generally imply some quality requirements!  
3. Spell out the resulting non-functional requirements in a verifiable form.
