[[Machine Learning]]

Classification is **a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data**. In classification, the model is fully trained using the training data, and then it is evaluated on test data before being used to perform prediction on new unseen data.

Classification approximates a mapping function (𝑓) from input variables (𝑋) to discrete output variables (𝑦).
Output variables are often called labels or categories. The mapping function predicts the class or category for a given observation. (is this an apple, is this a human, is this person happy).
