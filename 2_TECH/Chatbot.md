A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation with an end user. Not all chatbots are equipped with [[Artificial Intelligence]], but modern chatbots increasingly use [conversational AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/conversational-ai) techniques such as [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] to understand user questions and automate responses to them.

The next generation of chatbots with [[Generative AI]] capabilities will offer even more enhanced functionality with their understanding of common language and complex queries, their ability to adapt to a user’s style of conversation and use of empathy when answering users’ questions. Business leaders can clearly see this future: 85% of execs say generative AI will be interacting directly with customers in the next two years, as reported in [The CEO’s guide to generative AI study](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service) from IBV.  An enterprise-grade artificial intelligence solution can empower companies to automate self-service and accelerate the development of exceptional user experiences.

One of the most notable examples of Chatbots in the 2020s is [[ChatGPT]].
